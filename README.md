# State Machine Project - Turing Machine Definition
## Introduction
Welcome to the Turing Machine Definition module of the State Machine Project! This C++ program serves as a tool for defining and representing Turing Machines (TM) based on the given specifications. The Turing Machine, denoted as M = (Q, Σ, Γ, E₀, F, T), is a mathematical model used to describe the operation of a general computing machine.

## Key Components
**States (Q):** Represented unarily, where each state is assigned a unique unary representation.

**Alphabet (Σ):** The input alphabet, represented unarily.

**Tape Alphabet (Γ):** The tape alphabet, also represented unarily.

**Initial State (E₀):** The initial state of the Turing Machine.

**Final States (F):** States indicating acceptance of the input.

**Transitions (T):** Instructions dictating the machine's behavior, including reading symbols, moving the tape head, and transitioning between states.

## Usage
This program takes user input to define the Turing Machine's characteristics, such as the number of states, the alphabet, the tape alphabet, the initial state, final states, and transitions. It then generates the unary representations for states, alphabet symbols, and tape alphabet symbols. Finally, it outputs the formatted definition of the Turing Machine.
